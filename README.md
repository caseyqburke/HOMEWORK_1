FINTECH CASE STUDY: SQUARE      

Square

Square was founded by Jim McKelvey and Jack Dorsey in 2009.

The company has raised $590.5 million over 8 rounds of funding. They are now a publicly traded company under the ticker symbol, SQ. Square is a component of the Russel 1000 Index and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. 

The idea for the Square came about when artist Jim McKelvey was having issues selling $2000 of handblown glass he made. He was unable to process the sale so his friend, Jack Dorsey, went to work on creating a payment system that would be more convenient to use. Since then square has grown into a company that offers a multitude of servies that comapnies can use to help better manage their payroll, payment processing, loans, POS (Point of Sale ) systems amongst other features. Square's innovation makes it easier for companies to centralize all things to do with payments and financials into one platform. 

The companies intended customer started as small business who did not have the infrasctrure to be able to process payments or do financials efficiently. Square has made it possible to turn most computers, phones and tablets into point of sale systems to process payments. Over the growth of the Square, large sellers, which is defined by businesses that process over $125,000, now account for 51% of payments run through Square. Square sets itself apart by making it possible to accept payments and then directly have that information go into a terminal where you can check total sales, employee hours, tips, and other metrics that a company would usually have to put more work into organizing. 

Squares backend services are coded in Java and Ruby. Their apps rely on iOS and android systems. To file data Square uses Postgres, MySQL, HDFS and log files. 

Square is primarily in the Mobile payment and Point of sales but also is involved with lending to small businesses. Mobile payment and processing systems use has increased astronomically over the past 5 years. THe market is now seeing more convenient payment options and more dynamic POS systems that are not as complicated to use. This is driving increased sales and also decreasing the time it takes to process a payment. All of this information that is processed through Square is not put on a cloud system for backing up the data to make it available to the business whenever they need it. Since it is able to store this information on the cloud and organize it for the business owner into many different subsets, there has been more demand for data storage which makes evolving cloud technologies important for the business to operate. Square has also been able to cut a lot of the processing costs, making the field more competitive and ever evolving. Paypal, Intuit QuickBooks Gopayment, Clover and Shopify are some of Squares competitors in the processing payment and POS sides of their business.

The impact of square on the small businesses that use it is tremendous. IT has a 43.19% market share in in payment processing. Their Y/Y revenue growth in the 4th quarter of 2019 was 40.85% vs competitors 6.64% growth. The industry pays close attention to are user experience, eccomerce sales, customer support satisfaction, conversion rate, 


Squares performance over the years has been very impressive. IT has had increased revenue growth for the last 6 quarters. It saw 41% growth in GPV (growth payment volume) from large sellers, 24% growth from megasellers, which is defined by merchants that have $500,000 in yearly GPV. It subscription and services bases growth is up 155%. It has posted the fastest growth compared to its competitors. ITs net revenue rose 51% YoY versus 13% at Paypal and 20% at Amazon. Square has been consistent on taking over market share vs their competitors. 

Square should offer more business development systems and modeling so they can be more intune with customers needs and help them grow more. Other payment processor or accounting softwares have customer support that goes over business development and help create growth goals and help go over expenses that may be dragging down the compnay or a product that isnt selling and costing the business money. This would help created a better understanding and eventually a better relationship that would create loyalty between the Square and the customer while also being benefitial to them to use that data to help grow other businesses that they deal with. Using data analysis, Square, is able to take the metrics from each business it services and can offer metrics on spending, costs, loans, and any financial matter and present pertinent statistics to newer companies and have more informed knowledge and metrics to consult them on the best growth path.
